\section*{Today goals}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Identify venue ids that caused servor error and query them again.
	\item Exploit spatial tree and start finding similarities based on space
		and time pattern.
	\item Check twitter API rate and get some relevant tweets.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Today results}
\begin{itemize}
	\item query again: done
	\item spatial tree: The tree is finally built. It took more time because I
		had to convert latitude and longitude to suitable euclidean
		coordinates that works in every city.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Follow up}
\begin{itemize}
	\item spatial: Make Surrounding a proper class? Look at similarity.
	\item twitter rate.
\end{itemize}
