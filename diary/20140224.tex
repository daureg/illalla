\section*{Today results}
\begin{itemize}
	\item 50\% of reading the dataset is done by combining kosh and triton
	\item but for the other half, a ``small'' problem may be solve. Some short
		url link to checkin page like
		\href{https://fr.foursquare.com/tommiar/checkin/4d21eac35acaa35d8c03d435?s=plNfJpw51khCMN2yDrSfSl\_68lY}{4d21eac35acaa35d8c03d435?s=plNfJpw51khCMN2yDrSfSl\_68lY}.
		In that case, I assumed that the first part was a venue id but it's
		not. But it gives enough information to get this id by making a call
		to the
		\href{https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/checkins/checkins}{checkin}
		endpoint (500 calls per hour but hopefully it's not too common).
	\item code for making request about user and venue and put their profile
		into mongo.
\end{itemize}
