In addition to tagging content on social media, users can also localized them
on a map. Extracting metadata of localized photos from Flickr website as an
example, we try to uncover association rules between locations and tags. This
allows us to tackle three questions: find where a given tag appears
significantly, select tags that best characterize a given location and
retrieve which locations generate the more interest. We provide answers for
the city of San Francisco by filtering tags and computing spatial statistics.
Yet much remains to be done: validate these results, be less prescriptive but
more data driven and extend to different scales and others dimensions (time,
users).

\section{Introduction}

A common way of organizing information on websites it to rely on tags provided
by users. Although these words are chosen freely, we do not expect them to be
arbitrary and thus hope to extract limited semantics from them. In this work,
we focus on tags associated with geolocated photos extracted from
Flickr\footnote{\href{https://secure.flickr.com/}{http://www.flickr.com/}}.
Using this crowdsourced set of (tags, location) pairs, we investigate three
problems:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Given a tag, find the places in a city where it is significantly
		concentrated.
	\item Conversely, given a location, find the tags that best describe it
		compared with other locations of similar scale.
	\item Finally, find those places that seems to generate the most interest.
\end{itemize}

In the first case, it could be applied in a touristic context. When arriving
in a new city, a person interested in \textsf{baseball} or \textsf{streetart}
could find relevant places according to the experience of inhabitants and
previous visitors. The second answer could be used by Flickr to suggest
relevant tags when users upload photos. Consequently, more sensibly tagged
photos allow more relevant search results and improve the website user
experience. The last answer could for instance be the first step of an
automatic travel guide that select points of interest in a city or a region.

Other applications may include inferring missing information (like location or
time of the day) from the tags or create tailored visualisation.
