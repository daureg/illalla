# Mining User Home Location and Gender from Flickr Tags

Get 5000 users for each of 6 countries and their photos' metadata. If they have photos with city tag (or GPS location) for two different days (70% of them), accuracy is around 80%.

Gender can be identified by testimonial on the user profile page, gender tag in self photos or by assuming that the two gender use a different tagging vocabulary e.g. 

>	-  Female: roses, cookies, jewelry, toes, necklace, cupcakes, valentinesday, yummy, cupcake, haircut
>	
>	-  Male: panorama, longexposure, hdr, skyscraper, speed, 50mm, lens, cityscape, jet, canyon

It gives something like 80% precision and 85% recall
