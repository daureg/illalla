\section*{Today goals}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Debug \texttt{read\_foursquare.py} because it's too damn slow.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Today results}
\begin{itemize}
	\item I spent several hours installing latest version of curl, gnutls
		and their dependencies but that does not seem to change
		anything. So I will try to do the network part on kosh and only
		do DB insertion on triton.
	\item First experiment with leaflet clustering.
\end{itemize}
