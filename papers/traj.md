# Indexing Spatio-temporal Trajectories with Chebyshev Polynomials
Approximate d-dimensional trajectories by a Chebyshev Polynomial (represented by n coefficients). In this new space, it is more efficient to perform proximity search because this is lower bound of the euclidean distance and thus allow pruning. Trajectories must be of same length and they are projected in d one dimension time series.
# Robust and Fast Similarity Search for Moving Object Trajectories
Describe a new robust distance, Edit Distance on Real sequence and some associated pruning techniques.
# Finding Regions of Interest from Trajectory Data
After some preprocessing step, answer query in the form: find locations where people stop for such amount of time.
