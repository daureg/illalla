# Conceptualization of Place via Spatial Clustering and Co–occurrence Analysis

“Gruber considered tagging processes in social activities lead to tag ontologies.”

use openstreetmap for visualisation

First cluster photos using DBSCAN (Density–Based Spatial Clustering with Noise): a parameter allow to change the size of the cluster, which greatly influences subsequent results

Form a tag-photos matrix to compute tag correlation in every cluster. Can then be visualized as graph where edge width indicates correlation strength.
