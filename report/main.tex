\section{Introduction}

A common way of organizing information on websites it to rely on tags provided
by users. Although these words are chosen freely, we do not expect them to be
arbitrary and thus hope to be able to extract limited semantics from them. In
this project, we focus on tags associated with geolocated photos extracted
from
Flickr\footnote{\href{https://secure.flickr.com/}{http://www.flickr.com/}}.
Using this crowdsourced set of (tags, location) pairs, we investigate three
problems:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Given a tag, find the places in a city where it is significantly
		concentrated.
	\item Conversely, given a location, find the tags that best describe it
		compared with other locations of similar scale.
	\item Finally, find the places in the city that seems to generate the
		most interest.
\end{itemize}

In the first case, it could be applied in a touristic context. When arriving in a
new city, a person interested in \textsf{baseball} or \textsf{streetart} could
find relevant places according to the experience of inhabitants and previous
visitors. The second answer could be used by Flickr to suggest relevant tags
when users upload photos. Consequently, more sensibly tagged photos allow more
relevant search result and improve the website user experience. The last could
for instance the first step of an automatic travel guide that select point of
interest in a city or a region.

Other applications may include inferring missing information (like location or
time of the day) from the tags orâ€¦
