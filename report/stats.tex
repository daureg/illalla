The first thing was to look at the tags to get a sense of them. In San
Francisco after the preprocessing, there was a total of \numprint{4977625}
occurrences of the \numprint{145242} unique tags. But their distribution varies
widely, between the most popular one, \textsf{sanfrancisco}, used
\numprint{373427} times and the \numprint{101361} that are used less than 5
times. Some of them are shown in Table~\vref{tab:tags} but a more synthetic
visualization is presented in Figure~\vref{f:tags}, where we can see that like
words in a written documents, tags follows a power law.

\end{table}

After making these observations, I decided to consider only tags with enough
support, both to ease the computational effort and to avoid outliers. For each
tags, I compute three simple metrics, total count, distinct users count and
time span. Using the three threshold (150 photos, 25 users, 500 days), I kept
only \numprint{1836} tags. It may seem quite restrictive but they still cover
68.6\% of all occurrences and we can always change these thresholds
later\footnote{For instance, with $(20, 2, 0)$, we get \numprint{12959} tags
and 84.4\% coverage.}.

We can then conduct a similar analysis over the locations in which photos
appear. Because of their large number, it was not convenient nor readable to
display them individually. Therefore, I discretized space as a regular grid of
size 200 by 200. In that case, each rectangular cell is around $80\times 70$
meters and I used this same method for all other spatial computation. A
natural way of visualizing them is to draw a heatmap (Figure~\vref{f:heat}).
We notice again that they are far from being uniformly distributed and that
some neighborhood are more popular than others. More quantitatively, number of
photos of each location as a function of their rank (Figure~\vref{f:pdis}), we
notice that it first follows a power law and after some point, a more
abrupt one. Moreover, the same phenomena occurs for other grid size, albeit
with different $\alpha$ coefficient. Despite this similar behavior, it was
more tricky to explicitly exclude parts of the city.

Let us return to one of our original problem, find which tags describe a given
location. The first approach would to filter this \numprint{1836} tags to keep
only those that are enough concentrated at one position and reject those that
too uniformily distributed. After that, it would simply a matter of returning
those that appear in the place of interest. An example of this two kind of
tags are \textsf{museum} and \textsf{street}. As shown in Figure~\vref{f:sm},
\textsf{museum} photos are mostly located around five or six points whereas
\textsf{street} is more diffuse. But instead of looking at a map, we want a
numerical statistic that allow us to distinguish between this two cases.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]

Let first define some notation. As mentioned before, the city is divided in a
$g\times g$ grid made of rectangular cells $1$ through $g^2$ (like pictured on
the right).  For a cell $i$, let $b(i)$ be the total number of photos in cell
$i$\footnote{The so called background, hence the notation.}, $B=\sum_i b(i)$
the total number of photos and $b_f(i)$ the frequency of each cell. For a tag
$t$, we define in the same manner, $t(i)$, $T$ and $t_f(i)$, this time
considering only photos which have tags $t$.

With these frequencies we can compute entropy. Let $H(t,g) = -\frac{1}{2\log
g}\sum_{i=1}^{g^2} t_f(i)\log t_f(i)$ be the entropy of tag $t$ on a grid of
size $g$. The normalization factor ensure that regardless of $g$, the values
will range from 0 (all photos in the same cell) to 1 (uniform distribution).
