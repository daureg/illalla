\section*{Today goals}
\begin{itemize}
	\item get twitter API key
	\item leaflet heatmap or markers
	\item finish \texttt{xaa} (because it did not go very well last night,
		only \numprint{1669401} checkins in more than 5 hours).
	\item look at what kind of tag I got from my small local sample.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Today results}
\begin{itemize}
	\item twitter: fail again thus send a mail to the support team
	\item heatmap: there is now a working version but it is not really a
		priority. On the other it's pretty fun and I would be curious to try
		Leaflet
		\href{https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster}{clustering}
		module.
	\item \texttt{xaa}: It was again killed after 5 hours over only the last
		\numprint{570000} lines. Yet still \numprint{20369} valid checkins
		remained.
	\item tags: this one was easy since I have no tag yet.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Follow up}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Benchmark pycurl on triton
	\item Continue reading the dataset but do more high level stuff.
\end{itemize}
