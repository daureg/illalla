# Towards Geo-Social Intelligence: Mining, Analyzing, and Leveraging Geospatial Footprints in Social Media

Widespread geo tagging allows to study dynamic of human behavior and ideas and in turn enhance information system.

But user sharing such content are biased

tags similarity decrease with distance as well as their adoption becomes slower

analysis of temporal peak: “spray and diffuse pattern”

use this to predict tag propagation

“mines the spatio-temporal activity patterns of location-based crowds for augmenting traditional location-based search and for supporting enhanced location recommendations” (that have similar activity pattern that a query for instance)
