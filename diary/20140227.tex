\section*{Today results}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Get Flickr photos from Barcelona.
	\item Rewrote \texttt{VenueIdCrawler} to be more correct (previously, it
		considered almost every url as checkin because of \texttt{len(id\_) >=
		24} instead of of \texttt{len(id\_) > 24}. Now it should be good, but
		the whole dataset need to be re scanned (for at least the third time
		so hopefully the last one).
	\item Work a bit on categories and what information I can get about
		venues.
\end{itemize}
