# Spatio-temporal Characteristics of Bursty Words in Twitter Streams

A framework to extract bursty keywords from twitter, localize them and refine spatial analysis by co-occurrence graph regularization. Assume daily pattern for estimating above normal keywords frequency. Find anchor keywords by low entropy.

# A Probablistic Model for Spatio-temporal Signal Extraction from Social Media

social media as proxy (with bayesian uncertainty) for real world event

# Discovering Multiple HotSpots Using Geo-tagged Photographs

Assess the shape of famous landmark based solely on tag and metainformation (like focal length and view angle) (without any image processing)

# A Probabilistic Approach to Mining Geospatial Knowledge from Social Annotations

Spatial region of tags as GMM (learned by EM with BIC to avoid choose K and avoid overfit), used for place identification, photo location prediction given tag, learn relation between places.

# When a City Tells a Story: Urban Topic Analysis

Apply topic modelling (LDA) to fourquare check in (via tweets) to visualize city dynamics. Each hour of the week is a document, thus find topic like “morning” and “night life”.

# Event Detection from Flickr Data Through Wavelet-based Spatial Analysis

Find groups of consistent tag in the same place and time (possibly by periodicity). The Rattenbury Scale-structure Identification method consider only time. Authors instead mapped tag in a 3D space and suppress noise using wavelet transform. They find dense sub region in this transformed space by looking at connected components of a threshold graph. Look at the distribution over time to identify periodic event.
