# Delimiting Imprecise Regions with Georeferenced Photos and Land Coverage Data
an automated method for defining the boundaries of imprecise regions, combining interpolation from a set of points inside the region obtained from Flickr and evaluated through Kernel Density Estimation with refining the results based on region shrinkage (using terrain type discontinuity information provided satellite imagery)
